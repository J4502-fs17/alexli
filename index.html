  <p class="content"> My name is Alex Li. I am an international student from Guangzhou, China. I am currently a senior at Missouri School of Journalism in University of Missouri. I am doing convergence journalism, to be specific, multimedia producing.I enjoy storytelling through audio, photo and video, I am also good at visual stroytelling.
I have 4 years of experience in video shooting and post editing, basically as a student. Alhough I am in one of the best journalism school in U.S., I have little interest in working as a journalist, but huge interest in producing commercial pieces through storytelling. I attention the details, and would like to convey the culture behind the products to the audience. Also, I am proficient in Adobe Premiere and After Effects, which I think would be the most basic but important quality in commercial advertising. As a bonus, since my first language is Cantonese, working in Hongkong would definitely fit my language background. </p>
